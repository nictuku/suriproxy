- Better error treating
- Added support for "cloaked" URI queries using MD5.
  That way a provider can give the domain zones to his/her clients,
  but they will all be one-way "crypted" in MD5 hash, thus
  avoiding access to the proper list, which could be a security
  problem.
- Much better URI extracting code, using SpamAssassin's perl lib.
