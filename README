#warning#
Suriproxy was made with my needs in sight, so you will probably be 
bothered with its lack of features and almost non existent 
documentation. In case I get some feedback, I could try and improve it.
########

Suriproxy is a fast pre-queue filter for Postfix that will inspect all
messages content and REJECT those that contains Spamvertised URLs. 
It addresses the false positives problem by REJECTing messages instead 
of discarding, or worse, bouncing them.

See www.surbl.org for SURBL servers to use.

In case of a Suriproxy failure during scan, Postfix will issue smtp error 
code to the client, asking it to try again later. Also, the postmaster 
will receive a mail regarding the error.
As all GPL software, Suriproxy comes with no warranty against damage
and data loss. I use it in my production servers, so I guess it will
not harm your system either.

Remote clients will keep trying to deliver the messages, so you
hopefully will not lose mail if Suriproxy fails.
As it is in early stages of development and tests, keep an
eye on the logs.

### known problems ###

If you use amavisd-new as your 'talk server', you may notice these
errors:

Oct  6 12:56:46 host amavis[23867]: (23867-05) ESMTP TROUBLE, ABORTING: 
timed out
Oct  6 12:56:46 host amavis[23867]: (23867-05) ESMTP: NOTICE: ABORTING 
the session: timed out

They happen after a denial if the client quits the connection. 
Suriproxy will not issue a QUIT to amavisd-new, instead just close the 
connection. Ignore it :)

### How to use it ###

First, change master.cf in case you use postfix:

 smtp      inet  n       -       n       -       -       smtpd
   -o smtpd_proxy_filter=127.0.0.1:10023

If you are using a "content_filter", like amavisd-new, you should 
replace it.

You might want to increase smtpd_proxy_timeout to a bigger value, in
main.cf:

smtpd_proxy_timeout = 60m

In my own experience, this timeout also applies to the smtp dialog between
postfix and the client. So, big attachments that take more than
$smtpd_proxy_timeout to arrive would trigger errors. It's a bandwidth
limit issue. It doesn't seem to be Suriproxy's performance fault.

Then, decide which will be your after-pre-queue daemon. I am using
amavisd-new. You could use a special postfix smtp server instance.

If your after-pre-queue daemon is running at tcp:10024, you will
start Suriproxy with

# /usr/local/sbin/suriproxy 127.0.0.1:10023 127.0.0.1:10024

It will stay in the foreground by default.
You should run it in the foreground some time, so you could
get any warnings and errors in STDERR.

You could use Suriproxy as a post-queue filter, but it still does not
feature mail quarantine or non-discarding options. So you would 
definetly LOSE MAIL. If you are aware of the risk, change $mode to a 
non-"transparent" value, and use content_filter instead of 
smtpd_proxy_filter in your master.cf.

Accepted recipient whitelist formats:

abuse@
domain.tld
.domain.tld (whitelists subdomains too)
abuse@domain.tld
abuse@.domain.tld

See Postfix' SMTPD_PROXY_README.


TODO:
 - Textify log messages errors.
 - Quit the connection cleanly with the talk-server.
 - Make a decent documentation and website

NOT TO DO:
 - Improve recipient whitelist so the same message can be delivered
   to foo but not to bar.
